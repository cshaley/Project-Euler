# Project Euler
Charlie Haley's solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems in python.  
Many of the solutions make use of [prime sieving](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068372/fastest-way-to-list-all-primes-below-n) and [factor-generating](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6800193/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-of-finding-all-the-factors-of-a-number-in-python) functions lifted from stackoverflow.  
I use this primarily as a resource to brush up on my algorithmic, mathematical, and statistical knowledge as well as my programming skills in python.
